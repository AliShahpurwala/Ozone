## The simplest AQI API!

I want to make it easy to get your hands on accurate air quality data for your project, whatever it is. Ozone makes this as straightforward typing out just a few lines of code. Being a wrapper around the World Air Quality Index's API, you can trust the data you get, knowing that it's accurate and reliable.

Enjoy!
