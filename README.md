# Ozone

## The simplest AQI API!

I want to make it easy to get your hands on accurate air quality data for your project, whatever it is. Ozone makes this as straightforward typing out just a few lines of code. Being a wrapper around the World Air Quality Index's API, you can trust the data you get, knowing that it's accurate and reliable.

## World Air Quality Index and EPA attribution

This package is a wrapper around an API provided by the World Air Quality Index project. Without them as well as the US EPA, Ozone would not exist. Please consider visiting the WAQI website and contributing to their project if you have time:

Enjoy!
