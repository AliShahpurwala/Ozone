# Code Of Conduct

I value participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every contributor
has an _enjoyable_ and _fulfilling_ experience.

I want this package to be easy for _newbies_ and _anxious collaborators_, people who are looking to learn
and develop their skills.

It is expected from all the members of the community to conform to the following **Code of Conduct**:

```
* Encourage constructive discourse and discourage berating new contributors.

* Encourage new ideas about features and enhancements as long as they don't go against the goal of Ozone
  to be the most simplest, most effective package for fetching air quality data.

* Have a fun time.
```
